# @heybradon
A slackbot to post Dog pics to channel or post jokes

Simply send a chat to @heybradon in slack and if the bot finds that you typed doggo or chucknorris or yomama anywhere in that message he will serve you a good boy doggo pic or jokes per your message
<br><br>Reply will be posted on #botchannel for this round as i dont know how to target the channel sending the message. i get the id not name. will fixx that someday!

>If you see that @heybradon is showing offline visit https://serene-mesa-85664.herokuapp.com/ to restart the bot.
>The reason is its hosted on free heroku dyno and that goes to sleep every 30 min if no req for the dyno.
